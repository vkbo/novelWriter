<h1><a name="top"></a>Quick Reference Guide</h1>

<p>This is the quick reference guide for novelWriter. It briefly lists the key
features. The full documentation is available online at
<a href="https://novelwriter.readthedocs.io/">novelwriter.readthedocs.io</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="intro"></a>How it Works</h2>

<p>novelWriter is designed to be a simple and to-the-point application for
writing novels. It is not a fancy word processor, and doesn't want to be one
either.</p>

<p>All of the pieces of your project is kept in the project treeview in the main
window. The files are organised into <a href="#project-files">novel files and
notes</a>, which can be <a href="#syntax-tags">cross-referenced</a> and
displayed in the Outline tab in the main window.</p>

<p>The text editor panel allows for editing one file at a time, formatted with a
simplified <a href="#syntax">markdown syntax</a> and with some
<a href="#syntax-comments">additional features</a> specially designed for
novels. Spell checking is available through third party libraries.</p>

<p>At any time, the current document being edited, or any other document in the
project, can be viewed in the additional view panel. It is not open by default,
but can be activated by selecting a file in the treeview, and selecting
<code>Document &rsaquo; View Document</code> from the menu, or simply pressing
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>R</kbd>.</p>

<h2><a name="syntax"></a>Markdown Syntax</h2>

<p>Only a subset of markdown syntax is supported in the editor, with a few
special additions that are convenient for structuring and cross-referencing
novels. All supported features are listed in this section.</p>

<h3><a name="syntax-headers"></a>Headers</h3>

<p>Four levels of headers are supported:</p>

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <td>Code</td>
            <td>Description</td>
            <td>Shortcut</td>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><code># Title Text</code></td>
            <td>Heading Level 1 (Partition, Title)</td>
            <td><kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>1</kbd></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>## Title Text</code></td>
            <td>Heading Level 2 (Chapter)</td>
            <td><kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>2</kbd></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>### Title Text</code></td>
            <td>Heading Level 3 (Scene)</td>
            <td><kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>3</kbd></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>#### Title Text</code></td>
            <td>Heading Level 4 (Section)</td>
            <td><kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>4</kbd></td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>The text in parentheses indicate the structure level these headings are
treated as in novel files. The level of the heading indicates what the following
text is to be considered as. Whether it is the start of a partition, chapter,
scene, or a section within a scene. For note files, the headings have no special
meaning. In notes, a heading is just a heading.</p>

<p>Header formatting can be removed with the keyboard shortcut
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>0</kbd>.</p>

<h3><a name="syntax-emph"></a>Text Emphasis</h3>

<p>Three types of text emphasis or marking is supported:</p>

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <td>Code</td>
            <td>Description</td>
            <td>Shortcut</td>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><code>_text_</code></td>
            <td>Emphasised text (italicised)</td>
            <td><kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>I</kbd></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>**text**</code></td>
            <td>Strongly emphasised text (bold)</td>
            <td><kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>B</kbd></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>~~text~~</code></td>
            <td>Strikethrough text</td>
            <td><kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>-</kbd></td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>Some additional rules:</p>

<ol>
    <li>The emphasis and strikethrough formatting tags do not allow spaces
        between the words and the tag itself. That is, <code>**text**</code> is
        valid, <code>**text **</code> is not.</li>
    <li>More generally, the delimiters must be on the outer edge of words. That
        is, some <code>**text in bold**</code> here is valid, <code>some** text
        in bold** here</code> is not.</li>
    <li>If using both <code>**</code> and <code>_</code> to wrap the same text,
        the underscore must be the inner wrapper. This is due to the underscore
        also being a valid word character, so if they are on the outside, they
        violate rule 2.</li>
</ol>

<h3><a name="syntax-comments"></a>Comments</h3>

<p>Comments are supported, which is not standard in regular markdown. There are
two type of comments available:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Regular comments are lines starting with the character <code>%</code>.
        Such a line is ignored by the word counter, and can be filtered out when
        the project is exported.</li>
    <li>Synopsis comments are a special type of comments used to populate the
        Outline View. They are comments where the first word is
        <code>Synopsis:</code> (remember the <code>:</code>). They can also be
        filtered out when the project is exported.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can turn a regular line into a comment with the keyboard shortcut
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>/</kbd>, and remove it with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>0</kbd>.</p>

<p><b>Example:</b></p>

<pre>
% This is a regular comment.
% Synopsis: This is a synopsis style comment.
</pre>

<h3><a name="syntax-tags"></a>Tags and References</h3>

<p>Tags and references are used to cross-reference novel and note files, or note
and other note files. Here is a quick summary.</p>

<p>Tags and references use a keyword/value format indicated by the
<code>@</code> character as the first character on the line. The general format
is <code>@keyword: value1, value2</code>. The <code>:</code> after the keyword
is mandatory, and multiple values are separated with a <code>,</code>
character.</p>

<p>Possible keywords are as follows:</p>

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <td>Keyword</td>
            <td>Description</td>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><code>@tag</code></td>
            <td>Sets the reference tag for a text section</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>@pov</code></td>
            <td>References a character as the point-of-view character</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>@char</code></td>
            <td>References further non-POV characters</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>@plot</code></td>
            <td>References one or more plot or subplot</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>@time</code></td>
            <td>References one or more time event</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>@location</code></td>
            <td>References one or more plot location</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>@object</code></td>
            <td>References one or more plot object</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>@entity</code></td>
            <td>References one or more entity in the plot</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>@custom</code></td>
            <td>References one or more custom plot element</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<h2><a name="project"></a>Project Layout</h2>

<p>Projects are structured into a set of top level special folders called
<em>root folders</em>. The content is then added to these root folders as files,
optionally organised into subfolders. All structure elements are created via
the <code>Project</code> menu.</p>

<p>The organisation of files within the root folders are for the user's
convenience only. When the project files are assembled into a single documents,
only the order of the files is considered. Subfolders are ignored. Files can be
reordered by dragging and dropping them.</p>

<p>This section briefly describes the top level structure, and the types of
files that the user can choose from.</p>

<h3><a name="project-root"></a>Root Folders</h3>

<p>The most important of the root folders is the folder for the novel files
themselves. Additional root folders are meant for organising notes for outlining
the novel project. Root folders can be added from the <code>Project</code>
menu. Only empty folders can be deleted.</p>

<p>The different type of root folders are:</p>

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <td>Name</td>
            <td>Description</td>
            <td>Reference</td>
            <td>Code</td>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Novel</td>
            <td>The main folder for the novel's text</td>
            <td>&nbsp;</td>
            <td><code>N</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Plot</td>
            <td>For notes on the novel's plot and subplots</td>
            <td><code>@plot</code></td>
            <td><code>P</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Characters</td>
            <td>For notes on the novel's characters</td>
            <td><code>@pov</code>, <code>@char</code></td>
            <td><code>C</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Locations</td>
            <td>For notes on the novel's scene locations</td>
            <td><code>@location</code></td>
            <td><code>L</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Timeline</td>
            <td>For notes if the novel has multiple timelines</td>
            <td><code>@time</code></td>
            <td><code>T</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Objects</td>
            <td>For notes on special scene objects</td>
            <td><code>@object</code></td>
            <td><code>O</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Entities</td>
            <td>For notes on various plot entities</td>
            <td><code>@entity</code></td>
            <td><code>E</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Custom</td>
            <td>For any other type of notes</td>
            <td><code>@custom</code></td>
            <td><code>C</code></td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>The &ldquo;Reference&rdquo; column indicates which
<a href="#syntax-tags">keyword</a> can be used to reference a note in that
specific folder.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Code&rdquo; column indicates the short code for the file class of
each file in the root folder. These short codes are listed in the
<code>Flags</code> column of the project treeview in the main window.</p>

<h3><a name="project-files"></a>File Layout Types</h3>

<p>There is one file layout type for notes, and eight file layout types for
novel files. The layout types for novel files are mainly a way for the user to
quickly see what the files are intended for as the layout type is shown in the
project treeview. But they also have some effect on how the text within the file
is formatted on export. See the full documentation for further details.</p>

<p>The file layout types are described briefly in the table below.</p>

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <td>Type</td>
            <td>Description</td>
            <td>Code</td>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Note</td>
            <td>This is the one file type for note files</td>
            <td><code>Nt</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Title Page</td>
            <td>Intended for the cover page</td>
            <td><code>Tt</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Plain Page</td>
            <td>Intended for front matter pages</td>
            <td><code>Pg</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Book</td>
            <td>Generic file type for novel text</td>
            <td><code>Bk</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Partition</td>
            <td>Intended for pages between partitions</td>
            <td><code>Pt</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Chapter</td>
            <td>Intended for main story chapters</td>
            <td><code>Ch</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Unnumbered</td>
            <td>Intended for special chapters like a prologue</td>
            <td><code>Un</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Scene</td>
            <td>Intended for main story scenes</td>
            <td><code>Sc</code></td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>The &ldquo;Code&rdquo; column indicates the short code for the file type of
each file. These short codes are listed in the <code>Flags</code> column of the
project treeview in the main window.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong> that the structure of the novel text
itself, like what is a chapter and what is a scene, is not dictated by the file
type, but by the header level in the files. This is done so the user can freely
choose how they want to split up the project into files, and freely change it in
the process by splitting or merging files.</p>

<h2><a name="special"></a>Special Characters and Symbols</h2>

<p>A set of special characters and symbols can be inserted from the
<code>Insert</code> menu in the main window. These symbols can also be inserted
with a double combination of keyboard shortcuts. To activate insert mode, press
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>K</kbd>, followed by the key combination for the desired
symbol. The options are listed in the menu itself.</p>

<h3><a name="special-auto"></a>Auto-Replace Characters</h3>

<p>A few options for auto-replace as you type is available. These can be
controlled from the Preferences. These include replacing a series of two or
three regular hyphens with short and long dash, respectively. In addition,
triple dots can be replaced by the ellipsis character.</p>

<p>The editor also supports automatic conversion from straight quotes to a
user-defined set of quote symbols. The default setting is English 99 and 66
style quotes.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong> that the algorithm that detects whether a
left or right style quote symbol is needed is fairly basic and may not always
make the correct guess. In such cases, use the insert menu options to insert the
correct quote character instead.</p>
