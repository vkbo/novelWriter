<h2>Release Notes for 1.3.3</h2>
<p><i>Released on 13 June 2021</i></p>
<p>This patch release fixes a potential file encoding issue when running setup on Windows, and a
minor issue with the project word count not being updated immediately when a file is deleted. In
addition, the keyboard shortcuts to change focus between the project tree, the editor, the viewer,
and the outline panel, have been changed for Windows users. They keyboard shortcuts were
interfering with the Alt codes used for special characters. The shortcuts are unchanged for Linux
and macOS.</p>

<h2>Release Notes for 1.3.2</h2>
<p><i>Released on 30 May 2021</i></p>
<p>This is a patch release that fixes some minor issues. One issue was with the split tool, which
would drop the last line from the source document during a split if it was missing a final line
break. A minor issue with the display of word counts on the details panel under the project tree
has also been fixed. In addition, the setup script commands for Linux have been improved a bit.</p>

<h2>Release Notes for 1.3.1</h2>
<p><i>Released on 6 May 2021</i></p>
<p>This is a patch release primarily to fix a problem with the Qt translation library used to make
novelWriter available in multiple languages. One of the function calls made to the library was
added recently, in Qt 5.15, which many users on Linux will not have installed on their system. The
issue could be resolved by updating the library, but it's an unnecessary and inconvenient
restriction.</p>

<h2>Release Notes for 1.3</h2>
<p><i>Released on 2 May 2021</i></p>
<p>The main feature of the 1.3 release is internationalisation. The release introduces support for
Portuguese, French, and Norwegian for the main GUI, in addition to the default English. The
settings for choosing the GUI language can be found in the main Preferences.</p>
<p>The implementation is such that the projects themselves can use a different language than the
one selected for the GUI. To allow for better support for multiple language projects, the Build
Novel Project tool has the added option to select the language of the injected text into exported
documents. In particularly for the number words that can be added for chapter headers. Available
languages here are the same as mentioned above for the main GUI, plus German.</p>
<p>Settings have also been added in Preferences to allow for automatic injection of spaces or
non-breaking spaces in front of, or behind, certain characters. These are features generally
available in text editors for French, but the implementation in novelWriter simply makes them a
free text box where you can list all characters or symbols where you want a space added
automatically.</p>
<p>The translation files for this release have been provided by Bruno Meneguello for the Portuguese
translation, by Jan Lüdke (jyhelle) for the French translation, by Veronica Berglyd Olsen for the
Norwegian translation as well as the minor modifications for US English, and Marian Lückhof
provided the translation file for chapter numbers in German.</p>
<p>The work to rewrite novelWriter to allow for internationalisation was done by Bruno Meneguello
and Veronica Berglyd Olsen.</p>
