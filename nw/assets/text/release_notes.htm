<h2>Release Notes for 1.4 Beta 1</h2>
<p><i>Released on 13 June 2021</i></p>

<p>This is a preview release of novelWriter 1.4. It contains some new features and a lot of code
refactoring. This release is a testing release, and may contain bugs. Please be careful when using
this version to work on your projects.</p>
<p>Below are the main feature changes of this release.</p>

<h3>Line Breaks</h3>

<p>The way line breaks inside paragraphs work has been changed. A single line break is now treated
as a proper line break and will show up in the document viewer and exported documents. A single
line break does not start a new paragraph, but forces a break inside the paragraph like a Shift +
Enter does in most rich text editors. Two line breaks is still needed to start a new paragraph.</p>
<p>The old syntax of adding two spaces to force a line break within a paragraph will still work
as before, so there is no need to change your existing text if you've used this feature. However,
there is a new highlighting feature that will show you where in the text you have redundant spaces.
If you are used to having double spaces between sentences, you may want to switch off this
highlighting feature in Preferences as it will also detect those.</p>
<p>A helper function has been added to the Format menu that can look through a paragraph and remove
line breaks in case you've been using line breaks inside your existing text under the assumption
that the exporter and viewer will ignore them.</p>
<p>I hope this change will not be too inconvenient. I believe the new behaviour will make more
sense for most people. Especially considering some of the feedback I've gotten on how line breaks
work. The original implementation was following the Markdown standard, but since novelWriter is not
a proper Markdown editor and instead just borrows from Markdown, this behaviour always seemed a bit
unnecessary.</p>

<h3>Text Alignment and Indentation</h3>
<p>The default text alignment is left or justified based on your preferences. For documents with
the layout set to Title Page or Partitions, the default is centred. However, sometimes you may
want to override this default. A new set of codes have therefore been added to allow specifying
alignment as well as additional text margins on individual paragraphs.</p>
<p>The logic of the syntax is as follows:</p>
<p>A single angle bracket will push the text away from the edge it points away from. Therefore, a
single '&gt;' before the paragraph, or a single '&lt;' after the paragraph, will add indentation on
the respective side. It's perfectly valid to do this on both sides at the same time.</p>
<p>A double set of angle brackets will push the text all the way towards the opposite aide.
Therefore, a double set of '&gt;&gt;' before the paragraph will indicate right alignment, and a
double set of '&lt;&lt;' after the paragraph will force left alignment. Also here both can be used
at the same time, which results in the paragraph being centred.</p>
<p>Format menu entries and keyboard shortcuts have been added so that you don't have to memorise
these codes.</p>
