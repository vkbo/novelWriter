<h2>Release Notes for 1.5 Beta 1</h2>
<p><i>Released on 22 August 2021</i></p>

<h3>Release Notes</h3>
<p>This is a beta release of the next release version, and is intended for testing purposes. Please
be careful when using this version on live writing projects, and make sure you take frequent
backups.</p>

<h4>Layout Changes</h4>
<p>The main change in this release is the significant simplification of document layouts.
Previously, there were seven different layouts available for novel documents, in addition to the
one layout for project notes. The intention of the layouts were in part to define some default
formatting behaviour when exporting your project, and partially a way to indicate whether a
specific document was a chapter or scene.</p>
<p>All the seven layouts for novel documents have now been merged into a single layout called
simply "Novel Document". The other layout for "Project Note" remains unchanged. The functionality
provided by the various novel layouts have been implemented in other ways. They are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The distinction between Partition, Chapter, Scene and Unnumbered Chapter is displayed in a
  new way depending on your chosen user preferences.
    <ul>
      <li>If you use one of the coloured icon themes, the icon for Partition, Chapter and Scene
      files have a dedicated colour header in their icons. They are green, red and blue,
      respectively. Project notes have a yellow header.</li>
      <li>In addition, all novel documents starting with a level one or two header will have the
      document label indicated with bold and underline emphasis in the project tree. You can
      optionally disable this in Preferences.</li>
    </ul>
  <li>The last column of the project tree now only shows item status or importance. The class and
  layout codes that used to follow the status icon has been dropped. The status label is shown
  instead, but the label text can be switched off in Preferences if you just want a clean column
  with only the coloured status icon.</li>
</ul>

<p>Due to the removal of layouts that dictate some elements of the formatting of exported projects,
you will need to make some minor modifications to some of your project files. The changes you need
to make are the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>For the previous "Title Page" documents, you must change the header from "# Novel Title" to
  "#! Novel Title" in order to preserve the previous functionality. Also text paragraphs are no
  longer automatically centred. You can instead achieve this with paragraph formatting codes. These
  are available from the Format menu.</li>
  <li>For the previous "Plain Page" documents, which were used to force a page break in the
  generated output, you must instead use the new page break code to achieve the same effect. This
  is available from the Insert menu, but all you need to do is to add a line with "[NEW PAGE]"
  where you want the new page to start.</li>
  <li>For the previous "Unnumbered Chapter" documents you must change the header from "## Chapter
  Name" to "##! Chapter Name" to indicate you want the automatic numbering disabled. The
  alternative "## *Chapter Name" syntax has also been dropped.</li>
</ul>

<p>In any given project there should only be a handful of places where you  will need to make these
modifications. Hopefully it won't be too much of an inconvenience. The benefit of these changes is
that these formatting codes can be used anywhere in any document, no matter how you want to lay out
your file structure.</p>
<p>You will also find these changes described in the documentation.</p>

<h4>Other Changes</h4>
<p>Several improvements have been made to the project index, which means the index will be
automatically rebuilt when you open a project for the first time in the new version. You will get a
notification about this. This is expected.</p>
<p>The ODT export tool has also been improved. The code that writes out text paragraphs has been
rewritten and now conforms more closely to the open document standard. Most of these improvements
will not be noticeable to you as a user, but you may notice that the exported document will now
allow multiple consecutive spaces. Previously, adding two spaces, for instance, would be
concatenated into a single space in the exported document.</p>

<h4>GUI Changes</h4>
<p>Due to the above changes, the GUI has been altered a bit. The main changes are in the project
tree. These changes are also reflected in the details panel below the project tree, and to a lesser
extent in the Outline tab.</p>
