<h2>Release Notes for 1.0 RC2</h2>
<p><i>Released on 13 December 2020</i></p>
<p>This second release candidate for 1.0 comes with only minor changes and improvements, and a
handful of minor bugfixes.</p>
<p>Among the improvements is the addition of all the possible @-keywords for tags and references to
the "Insert" menu under the sub-menu "Tags and References". The "Help" menu has also received a few
improvements and additional links to useful webpages. This release also adds a "Release" notes tab
to the "About novelWriter" dialog. The release notes are displayed automatically the first time you
launch novelWriter after updating to a new version.</p>
<p>Among the fixes is better support for high resolution screens. A few elements on the GUI did not
scale properly, among them the document editor and viewer header and footer. These were clipped on
high res screens due to an underlying issue with the Qt widget underestimating how much space it
required to accommodate the text. Unfortunately, dragging the novelWriter app between screens of
different scaling factors is not currently supported. However, the GUI should scale properly to the
scaling factor on the screen it is opened on.</p>
<p>The work leading up to this release has mostly been focused on improving the test coverage of
the source code of novelWriter. This helps to ensure that the code does what it is intended to do,
and is able to handle corner cases and unexpected external errors and user actions that may occur.
While writing these tests, a number of minor potential issues have been uncovered and handled. Most
of these are corner cases that may not even be reachable by unexpected user actions.</p>
<p>Hopefully, these changes have resulted in an even more stable version of novelWriter. If no more
issues are discovered, the next release will be the final version 1.0 release.</p>

<h2>Release Notes for 1.0 RC1</h2>
<p><i>Released on 16 November 2020</i></p>
<p>This is the first release candidate for the upcoming release of novelWriter 1.0.</p>
<p>Since the fifth beta release about four weeks ago, not much has been changed in novelWriter. A
few minor tweaks have been made to the GUI.</p>
<p>A number of features and tools are now automatically switched off when there is no project or
document open for those features to act upon. Previously, this was a bit inconsistent, although no
serious bugs have been reported or encountered.</p>
<p>Most of the minor changes in this release should not be noticeable to most users. However, there
are a couple of noticeable changes.</p>
<h3>Typewriter Mode</h3>
<p>The "Typewriter Mode" of the editor has been improved. Essentially, this feature is a sort of
smart scroll. It tries to keep the cursor stationary in the vertical direction, and will try to
scroll the document up when the cursor skips to a new line while typing (or down in case of
backspaces). This is similar to the way a typewriter scrolls the paper when hitting the return key.
It improves the writing experience as the current active line will stay at the same eye height
level on the screen.</p>
<p>Previously, the feature would lock the cursor to a given vertical position defined by the user.
Now, instead, the cursor will remain stationary in the vertical direction at any position the user
sets it to by mouse click or keyboard navigation. The user can define a minimum distance from the
top where this feature is activated. These changes makes it more flexible in terms of where the
focus is in the editor. The feature can be controlled from the main Preferences.</p>
<h3>Switching Syntax Theme</h3>
<p>It is now possible to switch syntax highlighting theme without restarting novelWriter.
Previously, changing the theme would only half-way update the document, header and footer
background and text colours. The new settings would not be fully applied until the application was
shut down and started again, thus making it a bit tedious to look through syntax themes to find the
one you want.</p>
<p>Switching main GUI theme still requires a restart.</p>
