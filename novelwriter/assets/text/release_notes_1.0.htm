<h2>Release Notes for 1.0.4</h2>
<p><i>Released on 3 February 2021</i></p>
<p>This patch release fixes a couple of minor issues with the Preferences dialog and the behaviour
of one of the keyboard shortcuts.</p>
<p>Aside from these fixes, the main point of this patch is to add new setup features for
novelWriter on Windows. A Windows installer will no longer be provided for the foreseeable future,
and instead functionality has been added to the main setup script to create desktop and start menu
icons.</p>

<p><i>The full changelog is available
<a href="https://github.com/vkbo/novelWriter/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md">here</a>.</i></p>

<h2>Release Notes for 1.0.3</h2>
<p><i>Released on 24 January 2021</i></p>
<p>This patch release fixes a minor bug sometimes encountered when running novelWriter from command
line on Windows. In addition, the Solarized Dark and Solarized Light themes have been added to the
selection of GUI and syntax themes by a user contribution.</p>
<p>The main change in this release is to the install scripts and the documentation related to
installing and running novelWriter. The primary change is a different method of packaging the app
for Windows. Instead of building an <i>.exe</i> file, the new setup instead builds a runnable zip
file <i>.pyz</i>. The executable would often be mistakenly flagged by virus control software due to
the packaging tools. This is a known problem with pyinstaller and similar tools, but such warnings
are always concerning even if they are false positives.</p>

<h2>Release Notes for 1.0.2</h2>
<p><i>Released on 19 January 2021</i></p>
<p>This patch release fixes a few minor cosmetic issues, a minor issue with the indexer, and a bug
when adding words to the user's own spell check dictionary. Additionally, the documentation has
been updated based on user feedback, and some install issues resolved.</p>

<hr/>

<h2>Release Notes for 1.0.1</h2>
<p><i>Released on 10 January 2021</i></p>
<p>This release is mainly to bring the documentation up to date, as I forgot to update the install
instructions in the original 1.0 release. I also forgot to change the various settings and help
texts that describe novelWriter as under initial development (beta state).</p>
<p>Some minor improvements have been made to the "Edit Project Item" dialog and some restrictions
on the settings available for documents created in the "Outtakes" folder relaxed. A few minor
issues with the document and project changed icons on the status bar have also been resolved. The
indicators were previously set to changed status even if no actual change had been made to the
project.</p>

<h2>Release Notes for 1.0</h2>
<p><i>Released on 3 January 2021</i></p>
<p>Based on my own testing and usage, and no serious bugs discovered in quite some time (aside from
a few corner case issues), it appears that novelWriter is stable enough for a 1.0 release. Thanks
to all the new users who keep providing feedback on bugs, cosmetic issues, or suggesting
improvements and new features. I'm glad to hear that others find my application useful, and I will
keep making improvements as I get new suggestions and have new ideas myself. At the same time, I
will continue to keep novelWriter simple and clean and avoid feature-bloat.</p>
<p>This release mainly fixes cosmetic and other minor issues to the user interface and makes a few
minor improvements to some less used features. Aside from this, nothing major has changed since the
last release candidate.</p>
<p>This release concludes over two years of tinkering with this project. The project grew out of
numerous lunch and coffee discussions with my colleague Marian LÃ¼ckhof at my former job. We were
both looking for a tool for writing novels on Linux that suited our needs. We started assembling a
wish list of features that has become novelWriter. In addition, users on GitHub have continued to
test new features, provide very helpful feedback, and make new suggestions for improvements.
Especially the feedback from @johnblommers has been helpful during much of the initial development
time. Over the last months more users have started posting ideas and feedback. Thanks to all of you
for your contributions.</p>
<p>The 1.0 release is intended as a first release of the core features of novelWriter. That does
not mean that all planned features have been fully implemented. There is a long list of ideas and
suggestions to consider and implement. New ideas and suggestions are welcome. Either as feature
requests in the issue tracker, or if not fully formed, can be discussed on the
<a href="https://github.com/vkbo/novelWriter/discussions">discussions page</a>.

<h2>Release Notes for 1.0 RC2</h2>
<p><i>Released on 13 December 2020</i></p>
<p>This second release candidate for 1.0 comes with only minor changes and improvements, and a
handful of minor bugfixes.</p>
<p>Among the improvements is the addition of all the possible @-keywords for tags and references to
the "Insert" menu under the sub-menu "Tags and References". The "Help" menu has also received a few
improvements and additional links to useful webpages. This release also adds a "Release" notes tab
to the "About novelWriter" dialog. The release notes are displayed automatically the first time you
launch novelWriter after updating to a new version.</p>
<p>Among the fixes is better support for high resolution screens. A few elements on the GUI did not
scale properly, among them the document editor and viewer header and footer. These were clipped on
high res screens due to an underlying issue with the Qt widget underestimating how much space it
required to accommodate the text. Unfortunately, dragging the novelWriter app between screens of
different scaling factors is not currently supported. However, the GUI should scale properly to the
scaling factor on the screen it is opened on.</p>
<p>The work leading up to this release has mostly been focused on improving the test coverage of
the source code of novelWriter. This helps to ensure that the code does what it is intended to do,
and is able to handle corner cases and unexpected external errors and user actions that may occur.
While writing these tests, a number of minor potential issues have been uncovered and handled. Most
of these are corner cases that may not even be reachable by unexpected user actions.</p>
<p>Hopefully, these changes have resulted in an even more stable version of novelWriter. If no more
issues are discovered, the next release will be the final version 1.0 release.</p>

<h2>Release Notes for 1.0 RC1</h2>
<p><i>Released on 16 November 2020</i></p>
<p>This is the first release candidate for the upcoming release of novelWriter 1.0.</p>
<p>Since the fifth beta release about four weeks ago, not much has been changed in novelWriter. A
few minor tweaks have been made to the GUI.</p>
<p>A number of features and tools are now automatically switched off when there is no project or
document open for those features to act upon. Previously, this was a bit inconsistent, although no
serious bugs have been reported or encountered.</p>
<p>Most of the minor changes in this release should not be noticeable to most users. However, there
are a couple of noticeable changes.</p>
<h3>Typewriter Mode</h3>
<p>The "Typewriter Mode" of the editor has been improved. Essentially, this feature is a sort of
smart scroll. It tries to keep the cursor stationary in the vertical direction, and will try to
scroll the document up when the cursor skips to a new line while typing (or down in case of
backspaces). This is similar to the way a typewriter scrolls the paper when hitting the return key.
It improves the writing experience as the current active line will stay at the same eye height
level on the screen.</p>
<p>Previously, the feature would lock the cursor to a given vertical position defined by the user.
Now, instead, the cursor will remain stationary in the vertical direction at any position the user
sets it to by mouse click or keyboard navigation. The user can define a minimum distance from the
top where this feature is activated. These changes makes it more flexible in terms of where the
focus is in the editor. The feature can be controlled from the main Preferences.</p>
<h3>Switching Syntax Theme</h3>
<p>It is now possible to switch syntax highlighting theme without restarting novelWriter.
Previously, changing the theme would only half-way update the document, header and footer
background and text colours. The new settings would not be fully applied until the application was
shut down and started again, thus making it a bit tedious to look through syntax themes to find the
one you want.</p>
<p>Switching main GUI theme still requires a restart.</p>
