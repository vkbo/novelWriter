<h2>Release Notes for 2.2</h2>
<p><i>Released on 17 December 2023</i></p>

<p>Scroll down for <a href="#patch">Patch Notes</a></p>

<p>This release comes with a number of new features. These are some highlights.</p>
<p>In addition to the common Markdown style formatting for bold, italic and strike through, a set
of new shortcodes have been added. The shortcodes are far more flexible than the Markdown style
syntax, and can be used for more complex formatting cases. Like when you need to add multiple,
overlapping formats, or add emphasis to just a part of a word. The shortcodes also allow for
underline, subscript and superscript, which the Markdown syntax does not. The new formats are
available in the "Format" menu, and in a new toolbar in the editor that can be enabled by clicking
the three dots in the top–left corner. The shortcode format was chosen because it can later be
extended to include other requested features as well. Please have a look at the documentation for
more details about the new shortcodes.</p>
<p>The Tags and References system has been improved. The tags themselves are no longer case
sensitive when you use them in references, but they are still displayed as you typed them in the
tag definition when they are displayed in the user interface. Starting to type the '@' symbol in
the text editor, on a new line, will now open an auto-completer menu which will display available
options. It may not display all of your tags if you have a lot of them, but starting to type more
characters will filter the list down further.</p>
<p>You can now automatically create a note file for a new tag that you have added to a reference
list in a document, but is not yet defined in a project note. So, for instance, if you come up with
a new character while writing, and add a new tag to your '@char' references, you can right-click
the new tag and create a new note for that entry directly. In addition, it is now also possible to
right-click a heading in an open document and set the item label in the project tree to match the
heading.</p>
<p>In addition to the changes in the editor, the "References" panel below the document viewer has
also been completely redesigned. It now shows all the references to the document you are viewing as
a list, with a lot more details than before. In addition, tabs in the panel will appear to show all
the tags you have defined in your notes, sorted as one tab per category. Like for instance
Characters, Locations, Objects, etc. You can also give each note a short description comment on the
same format as the summary comments for chapters and scenes. The short description comment can be
added from the "Insert" menu under "Special Comments".</p>
<p>The last major change in this release is the new multi-select feature in the project tree. You
can now select multiple documents and folders using the mouse while pressing 'Ctrl' or 'Shift'. By
right-clicking the selected items, you can perform a limited set of operations on all of them, like
changing active status, and the status or importance labels. You can also drag and drop multiple
items under the condition that all the selected items are in the same folder, at the same level.
This restriction is in place due to limitations in the framework novelWriter is based on. But this
should help in cases where multiple documents need to be moved in and out of folders or between
folders. Note that adding the multi-select feature meant that the undo feature of the project tree
had to be removed. It may be added back later.</p>
