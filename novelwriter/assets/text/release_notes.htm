<h2>Release Notes for 1.6</h2>
<p><i>Released on 20 February 2022</i></p>

<p>This release does not introduce any major new features, but is instead a collection of minor
improvements and tweaks based on user requests. There are also a number of changes under the hood
to improve the structure and performance of novelWriter.</p>
<p><u>Some key improvements to the user interface are:</u></p>
<p>&#10003; The max text width setting in Preferences now also applies to the document viewer, and
the setting itself on the Preference dialog has been simplified a bit.</p>
<p>&#10003; When text is selected in the document editor, the number of words selected is displayed
in the editor's footer area.</p>
<p>&#10003; The search tool in the document editor now shows the number of results in the
document.</p>
<p>&#10003; The Enter and Ctrl+O keyboard shortcuts should now work the same way in all tree
views.</p>
<p>&#10003; It is now possible to set a blank section title format on the Build Novel Project tool
and get empty paragraphs in the output. Previously, a blank format would just remove the section
break entirely. This change allows the user to define hard and soft scene breaks using level three
and four headings. The scene and section titles can be hidden completely with two new switches
added to the user interface.</p>
<p><u>Other feature changes include:</u></p>
<p>&#10003; The project index is now automatically rebuilt in the event it is empty or incomplete
when the project is opened.</p>
<p>&#10003; The user can now add their own syntax and GUI theme files in the app folder in their
user area on the host operating system. Where the custom files must be added is described in the
documentation.</p>
<p>&#10003; A Windows installer is yet again provided for novelWriter. If you have novelWriter
installed using another method, make sure you uninstall it properly first as the two methods are
not compatible.</p>
<p>&#10003; Release versions for Ubuntu 21.04 have been dropped, and added for the upcoming Ubuntu
22.04.</p>
<p>&#10003; Most translations have been updated. A Dutch translation is in the works.</p>
