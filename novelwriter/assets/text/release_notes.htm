<h2>Release Notes for 1.5</h2>
<p><i>Released on 19 September 2021</i></p>

<p>This release reduces the number of document layouts from eight to two. The full list of changes
is described in the "Novel Document Layouts" section below.</p>
<p>Due to this change, the main project file for your projects will need to be updated when you
first open them in novelWriter 1.5. This is done automatically. The index is updated as well. When
this conversion is done, you can no longer open the project in an older version of novelWriter.</p>
<p>You may also have to make a handful of changes in your novel documents as novelWriter will not
make any automated changes to your actual text. However, the changes are minimal and in any case
only affects the way your manuscript looks like when exported via the Build Novel Project tool.
These details are also described below.</p>
<p>From this release on, Debian packages will be provided for Mint, Ubuntu and Debian users. A new
<a href="https://launchpad.net/~vkbo/+archive/ubuntu/novelwriter">PPA</a> has also been created.
This allows users to install and update novelWriter automatically on these Linux distros.</p>

<h4>Novel Document Layouts</h4>
<p>The main change in this release is the significant simplification of document layouts.
Previously, there were seven different layouts available for novel documents, in addition to the
one layout for project notes. The original intention of these layouts were partially to define some
default formatting behaviour when exporting your project, and partially as a way to indicate
whether a specific document was a partition, chapter or scene.</p>
<p>With this release, all the seven layouts for novel documents have been merged into a single
layout called simply "Novel Document". The other layout, "Project Note", remains unchanged. The
functionality provided by the various novel layouts have been implemented in other ways, and a few
new formatting codes have been added to accommodate the formatting functionality lost with the
removal of the layouts. They are all available in the Format and Insert menus.</p>
<p>The changes you need to make to your project should be limited to altering a handful of titles
and maybe insert a page break code here and there. The only title formats you need to update are
those for the main novel title and for your unnumbered chapters, if you have any.</p>
<p>Novel titles need to be altered from "# Novel Title" to "#! Novel Title" and unnumbered chapters
from "## Chapter Name" or "## *Chapter Name" to "##! Chapter Name". That is all. For inserting page
breaks, you can add a single line with the command "[NEW PAGE]" where you want the break to be
inserted. As before, page breaks are automatically inserted in front of all partition and chapter
titles.</p>
<p>You will find these changes described in more detail in the documentation in the
"<a href="https://novelwriter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage_projectformat.html#a-prjfmt-1-3">Format 1.3 Changes</a>"
section.

<h4>GUI Changes</h4>
<p>Due to the above changes, the GUI has been altered a bit. The main changes are in the project
tree. These changes are also reflected in the details panel below the project tree, and to a lesser
extent in the Outline tab.</p>
<p>The layouts were previously a way to indicate the purpose of a specific novel document, like
whether it was a chapter or scene. With these layouts gone, the distinction is instead indicated by
other visual means.</p>
<p>The project index will now record the level of the first header of your document, and select a
different icon for documents with a partition, chapter or scene header. These are colour coded as
green, red, and blue respectively. The project notes have also received a new icon, with a yellow
colour code. Due to this change, the grey icon themes have been removed.</p>
<p>In addition, novel documents with a partition or chapter header will have the document label
viewed as bold and underlined. This feature can be disabled in Preferences if you want a cleaner
look in the project tree.</p>

<h4>Other Changes</h4>
<p>Several improvements have been made to the project index, which means the index will be
automatically rebuilt when you open a project for the first time in the new version. You will get a
notification about this.</p>
<p>The ODT export tool has also been improved. The code that writes out text paragraphs has been
rewritten and now conforms more closely to the Open Document standard. Most of these improvements
will not be noticeable to you as a user, but you may notice that the exported document will now
allow multiple consecutive spaces. Previously, two spaces, or more, would be concatenated into a
single space in the exported document.</p>
<p>The internal spell check tool has been removed. If you want spell checking, you must install the
Spell Enchant tool. The internal spell checker was only ever added because the Python package for
Spell Enchant was not available on 64-bit Windows. This was corrected over a year ago. The main
issue with the internal spell checker was that it only included English, and the large dictionary
files had to be shipped with novelWriter.</p>
<p>Finally, a PDF version of the documentation should now be shipped with your install package. If
it is available, a "User Manual (PDF)" option should be visible in the Help menu. This should give
you access to the documentation also when you don't have an active internet connection.</p>
