<h2>Release Notes for 1.1.1</h2>
<p><i>Released on 21 February 2021</i></p>
<p>This patch makes a couple of minor improvements to the GUI. The keyboard shortcut for deleting
entries in the project tree has been changed from "Ctrl+Del" to "Ctrl+Shift+Del" to free up that
shortcut for the document editor. It is now possible to use the shortcut for deleting the word in
front of the cursor, a common and useful feature of many text editors.</p>
<p>The way the negative word count filter option works on the Writing Statistics tool has been
changed to be more intuitive. Enabling this filter now appears to remove all negative entries
without altering the other entries. Previously, the removed negative counts would be included in
the following entries to make it consistent with the total word count. In addition, writing
sessions shorter than five minutes, and with no change in the word count, are no longer recorded in
the session log file.</p>
<p>Other changes include improving the speed of the internal spell checker, used when the Enchant
spell check library isn't available. The internal spell checker is no longer significantly slower,
but is still lacking in functionality compared to Enchant.</p>

<h2>Release Notes for 1.1</h2>
<p><i>Released on 7 February 2021</i></p>
<p>The main change in this release is the addition of a new tab to the project tree on the left
side of the main window. The regular project tree is now on a tab named "Project", while a new tab
named "Novel" displays a simpler version of the information on the main "Outline" page. It lists
all the headers of the novel part of the project, as well as the word count and point-of-view
character of each section. This is an alternative way to navigate the novel part of the project.
The various tree views are now also kept better in sync when the user selects various documents and
headers.</p>
<p>In addition, a new information dialog named "Project Details" has been added. It replaces the
"Details" tab in "Project Settings", and adds more information about the novel part of the project.
In particular, a "Table of Contents" in the "Contents" tab displays a summary of the main parts
and chapters of the project, their total word counts, and an estimated page count. This was made in
response to users asking for ways to estimate the total page count of the project. The page count
is estimated based on a words per page setting, which can be changed on the dialog window.</p>
<p>Since the tabs below the project tree now add some extra room on the GUI, some convenient
buttons have been added in the same area, with direct access to "Project Details", "Writing
Statistics" and "Project Setting".</p>
<p>A few other minor changes have been made as well. The Preferences dialog has been improved with
clearer categories and hopefully better help text. Some new options have been added too. They allow
syntax highlighting of multi-paragraph quotes. The highlighter can now optionally accept quotes to
be left "hanging", that is, no closing quote in the same paragraph.</p>
