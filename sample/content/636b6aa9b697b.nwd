### Making a Scene

@pov: Jane

A scene is defined by a level three heading, like the one at the top of this page. The scene will be assigned to the chapter preceding it in the project tree.

Each paragraph in the scene is separated by a blank line. The text supports minimal formatting, like **bold**, _italic_ and **_bold italic_**. You can also ~~strike through~~ text. There is **some support for _nested_ emphasis**, but there are some known limitations. If the syntax highlighter doesn’t show it correctly, the export tool will not either.

In addition, the editor supports automatic formatting of “quotes”, both double and ‘single’. Depending on the syntax highlighter, these can be in different colours. “You can of course use **bold** and _italic_ text inside of quotes too.”

If you have the need for it, you can also add text that can be automatically replaced by other text when you generate a preview or export the project. Now, let’s auto-replace this A with <A>, and this C with <C>. While <E> is just <E>. Press Ctrl+R to see what this looks like in the view pane.

The editor also supports non breaking spaces, and the spell checker accepts long dashes—like this—as valid word separators. Regular dashes are also supported – and can be automatically inserted when typing two hyphens.

Thin spaces and thin non-breaking spaces are also supported from the Insert menu, and can be used to separate numbers from their units, like: 25 kg.

#### Some Section Here

If you need to split a scene file up into further pieces, you can do so with the level four heading, like the one above this paragraph. This is referred to as a “section” in the documentation.

Both scene and section titles can be left out of the final exported document. The formatting of titles can be selected from the Build Novel Project dialog. You can also have them replaced with scene separators like “* * *”.

#### Text Alignment

The text by default will have the left or justified alignment in the main text files in your project. You can also specify alignment for a specific paragraph by “pushing” it away from an edge with a set of ‘>>’ or ‘<<’ symbols, like so:

This text is left-aligned. <<

>> This text is right-aligned.

>> This text is centred. <<

#### Text Indent

You can indent a paragraph from both the left and right margin with ‘>’ and ‘<’ symbols.

> This paragraph is indented from both the left margin and the right margin. This is useful for when you want to quote a large chunk of text for instance. <
