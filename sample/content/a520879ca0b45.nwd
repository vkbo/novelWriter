### Scene One

@pov: Jane
@focus: John

A project can have multiple novel root folders for multiple novels. This is the first scene of a sequel to the first novel.

In this way, the writer can keep the same notes for multiple novels. This can be especially useful if the writer is planning a multi-novel story in advance.
