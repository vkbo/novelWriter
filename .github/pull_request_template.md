Please check the following before you make a pull request:

* The branch you are making the pull request from (in your own fork) has a unique and descriptive
  name. Do not make a pull request directly from your copy of `main`, `dev` or `testing`.
* If you are submitting translation files, only submit the files that you have added translations
  to, not the other .ts files that may have been updated in the process.
* Make sure your contribution follows the style guide and other requirements mentioned in the
  CONTRIBUTING.md file in the repository.
