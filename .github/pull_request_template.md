Please check the following before you make a pull request:

* The branch you are make the pull request from (in your own fork) must
  have a unique and descriptive name. Do not make a pull request
  directly from your copy of `main`, `dev` or `testing`.
* If you are submitting translation files, only submit the files that
  you have added translations to, not the other .ts files that may have
  been updated in the process.
* Make sure your contributions follow the style guide and other
  requirements mentioned in the CONTRIBUTING.md file in the repository.
