novelWriter is a plain text editor designed for writing novels assembled from
many smaller text documents. It uses a minimal formatting syntax inspired by
Markdown, and adds a meta data syntax for comments, synopsis, and
cross-referencing. It's designed to be a simple text editor that allows for
easy organisation of text and notes, using human readable text files as
storage for robustness.
