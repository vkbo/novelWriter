Description: A markdown-like text editor for planning and writing novels
 novelWriter is a plain text editor designed for writing novels assembled from
 many smaller text documents. It uses a minimal formatting syntax inspired by
 Markdown, and adds a meta data syntax for comments, synopsis, and
 cross-referencing. It's designed to be a simple text editor that allows for
 easy organisation of text and notes, using human readable text files as
 storage for robustness.
