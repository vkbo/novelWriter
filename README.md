novelWriter is a text editor designed for writing novels and larger
projects consisting of many smaller text documents. It uses its own
flavour of Markdown that adds a metadata syntax for comments, synopses,
and cross-referencing between files. Itâ€™s designed to be a simple and
allow for easy organisation of text and notes, saved as plain text files
for robustness.

The plain text files it uses are suitable for version control software
and for file synchronisation tools. The core project structure is stored
in a project XML file. Other metadata is primarily saved in JSON files.

The full documentation is available [at Read the
Docs](https://novelwriter.readthedocs.io).

## Implementation

The application is written in Python 3 using Qt5 via PyQt5. It is
developed on Linux, but it should in principle work fine on other
operating systems as well as long as dependencies are met. The unit
tests are run on the latest versions of Ubuntu Linux, Windows Server and
macOS.


# Installing and Running

For install instructions, please check the
[documentation](https://novelwriter.readthedocs.io/) in the [Getting
Started](https://novelwriter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/int_started.html)
section.

## TLDR Instructions

**Note:** You may need to replace `python` with `python3` and `pip` with
`pip3` in the instructions below on some systems. You may also want to
add the `--user` flag for `pip` to install in your user space only.

### Install from PyPi

novelWriter is available on
[pypi.org](https://pypi.org/project/novelWriter/), and can be installed
with:

```bash pip install novelwriter ``` Dependencies should be installed
automatically, but can also be installed directly with:

```bash
pip install pyqt5 lxml pyenchant
```

### Setup on Linux

If you're running from source, the following commands will set up
novelWriter on Linux:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py install
python setup.py xdg-install
```

### Setup on macOS

If you're running from source, the following commands will set up
novelWriter on macOS:

```bash
brew install enchant
pip3 install --user -r requirements.txt
pip3 install --user pyobjc
```

### Setup on Windows

For Windows, you can either install via PyPi, or use the Windows
installer available from the
[releases](https://github.com/vkbo/novelWriter/releases) page.

## Debugging

If you need to debug novelWriter, you must run it from command line. It
takes a few parameters, which can be listed with the switch `--help`.
The `--info`, `--debug` or `--verbose` flags are particularly useful for
increasing logging output for debugging.


# Key Features

Some features of novelWriter are listed below. Consult the
[documentation](https://novelwriter.readthedocs.io/) for more
information.

### Markdown Flavour

novelWriter is _not_ a full-feature Markdown editor. It allows for a
minimal set of formatting needed for writing text documents for novels.
These are currently limited to:

* Headings level 1 to 4 using the `#` syntax only.
* Emphasised and strongly emphasised text. These are rendered as
  italicised and bold text.
* Strikethrough text.
* Hard line breaks using two or more spaces at the end of a line.

That is it. Features not supported in the editor are also not exported
when using the export tool.

In addition, novelWriter adds the following, which is otherwise not
supported by Markdown:

* A line starting with `%` is treated as a comment and not rendered on
  exports unless requested.  Comments do not count towards the word
  count. If the first word of the comment is `synopsis:`, the comment is
  indexed and treated as the synopsis for the section of text under the
  same header.  These synopsis comments can be used to build an outline
  and exported to external documents.
* A set of meta data keyword/values starting with the character `@`.
  This is used for tagging and inter-linking documents, and can be used
  to generate a project outline.
* Non-breaking spaces are supported as long as your system is using at
  least Qt 5.9. For earlier version, non-breaking spaces are converted
  to normal spaces when saving the document. This is done by the Qt
  library.
* Thin spaces are also supported, as well as non-breaking thin spaces,
  with the same library version restriction as above.
* Tabs can be used in the text, and should be properly aligned. The
  width of a tab in pixels can be changed in Preferences. Note that for
  the HTML format, most browsers will treat a tab as a space, so it may
  not show up like expected. If you import the HTML file to Libre
  Office, for instance, they should appear as expected.

The core export format of novelWriter is HTML5. You can also export the
entire project as a single novelWriter Markdown-flavour document. In
addition, other exports to Open Document, PDF, and plain text is offered
through the Qt library, although with limitations to formatting.

The HTML format is well suited for file conversion tools and import into
other text editors.


### Colour Themes

The editor has syntax highlighting for the features it supports, and
includes a set of different syntax highlighting themes. The GUI also has
an optional dark theme in addition to the default system theme.

New themes can easily be added to the `nw/assets/themes` folder. Have a
look in the existing folders for examples of how to define the colours.


### Easy Organising of Project Files

The structure of the project is shown on the left hand side of the main
GUI. Project files are organised into root folders, indicating what
class of file they are. The most important root folder is the Novel
folder, which contains all of the files that makes up the finished
novel. Each root folder can have subfolders. Folders have no impact on
the final project structure, they are purely tools for organising the
files in whatever way the user needs.

The editor supports four levels of headings, which determines what level
the following text belongs to. Headings of level one signify a book or
partition title. Headings of level two signify the start of a new
chapter. Headings of level three signify the start of a new scene.
Headings of level four can be used internally in each scene to separate
sections.

Each novel file can be assigned a layout format, which shows up as a
flag next to the item in the project tree. These are mostly to help the
user track what they contain, but they also have some impact on the
format of the exported document. See the documentation for further
details.


#### Project Notes

Supporting note files can be added for the story plot, characters,
locations, story timeline, etc.  These have their separate root folders.
These are optional files.


### Visualisation of Story Elements

The different notes can be assigned tags, which other files can refer
back to using the `@` meta keywords. This information can be used to
display an outline of the story, showing where each scene connects to
the plot, and which characters, etc. occur in them. In addition, the
tags themselves are clickable in the document view pane, and
control-clickable in the editor. They make it possible to quickly
navigate between the documents while editing.
