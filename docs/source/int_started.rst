If you are using Windows or a Debian-based Linux distribtuion, you can install novelWriter from
package installers. If you are on macOS, you have the option to run novelWriter from a standalone
folder. See :ref:`a_started_minimal`. This option is also available for Windows and Linux. The
third option is to install novelWriter from the Python Package Index. See :ref:`a_started_pip`.

.. admonition:: Help Wanted
   :class: seealso

   If you would like to help making more installers, the project is currently loooking for people
   who can help make releases for Reed Hat-based Linux distros (RPM) and for macOS. See the issues
   posted for RPM_ and macOS_ on GitHub_.


.. _a_started_windows:

Install on Windows
==================

You can install novelWriter with both Python and library dependencies embedded using the Windows
Installer (setup.exe) file from the `main website`_, or from the Releases_ page on GitHub.
Installing it should be straightforward.

If you have any issues, try uninstalling the previous version and making a fresh install.


.. _a_started_debian:

Install on Debian/Ubuntu/Mint
=============================

A Debian package can be downloaded from the `main website`_, or from the Releases_ page on GitHub.
This package should work on both Debian, Ubuntu and Linux Mint.

If you prefer, you can also add the novelWriter repository on Launchpad to your package manager.


Ubuntu and Mint
---------------

You can add the Ubuntu PPA_ and install novelWriter with the following commands.

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo add-apt-repository ppa:vkbo/novelwriter
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install novelwriter

If you want pre-releases, add the ``ppa:vkbo/novelwriter-pre`` repository instead.


Debian
------

Since this is a pure Python package, the Launchpad PPA can in principle also be used on Debian.
However, the above command will fail to add the signing key.

Instead, run the following commands to add the repository and key:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo gpg --no-default-keyring --keyring /usr/share/keyrings/novelwriter-ppa-keyring.gpg --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv-keys F19F1FCE50043114
   echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/novelwriter-ppa-keyring.gpg] http://ppa.launchpad.net/vkbo/novelwriter/ubuntu focal main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/novelwriter.list

Then run the update and install commands as for Ubuntu:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install novelwriter

.. note::

   Please use the Ubuntu 20.04 packages for Debian. The newer Ubuntu packages use a different
   compression that Debian doesn't currently support.


.. _a_started_minimal:

Minimal Package Install
=======================

On the `main website`_ and on the Releases_ page on GitHub you will also find "Minimal Package"
install files for Windows, Linux and macOS. These are zip files of just the files you need to run
novelWriter on that specific platform.

These zip files don't include any dependencies, so you must install them separately.


.. _a_started_minimal_windows:

Windows
-------

First, make sure you have Python installed on your system. If you don't, you can download it from
`python.org`_. Python 3.6 or higher is required, but it is recommended that you install the latest
version.

Make sure you select the "Add Python to PATH" option during installation, otherwise the ``python``
command will not work in the command line window.

.. figure:: images/python_win_install.png
   :align: center
   :width: 500

When Python is installed, extract the novelWriter zip file and move the extracted folder to a
suitable location. You should probably not keep it on your desktop or in your downloads folder
where it may be accidentally deleted. Instead, move and rename it to for instance
``C:\novelWriter``.

After you've got the folder where you want it, open it and double-click the file named
``windows_install.bat``. This will open a command line window and run the setup script to install
dependencies, and add desktop and start menu icons.

Running ``windows_uninstall.bat`` will reverse the process if you wish to uninstall. After that,
you can just delete the novelWriter folder.


.. _a_started_minimal_linux:

Linux
-----

On Linux you need to install the following packages on Debian-based distros, including Ubuntu and
Linux Mint:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo apt install python3-pyqt5 python3-lxml python3-enchant

On Fedora, you need the following packages:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo dnf install python3-qt5 python3-lxml python3-enchant

A standard desktop launcher can be installed via the main setup script. It will create the needed
desktop file and add it to the Applications menu. The necessary icons will also be installed, and a
file association with ``.nwx`` files added.

To set this up, run the following from inside the extracted novelWriter folder:

.. code-block:: bash

   python3 setup.py xdg-install

This installs icons for the current user. Run with ``sudo`` to install system-wide.

To uninstall the icons, run:

.. code-block:: bash

   python3 setup.py xdg-uninstall


.. _a_started_minimal_mac:

macOS
-----

These instructions assume you're using brew, and have Python and pip set up. If not, see the
`brew docs`_ for help. The main requirements for novelWriter are installed via the requirements
file. You also need to install the ``pyobjc`` package, so you should run:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip3 install --user -r requirements.txt
   pip3 install --user pyobjc

For spell checking you may also need to install the enchant package. It comes with a lot of default
dictionaries.

.. code-block:: bash

   brew install enchant

With the dependencies in place, you can launch the ``novelWriter.py`` script directly to run
novelWriter.

.. note::
   Right now there isn't a better integration with macOS available. Contributions from someone more
   familiar with macOS would be very much appreciated. See the macOS_ issue on GitHub.


.. _a_started_pip:

Install from PyPi
=================

novelWriter is also available on the Python Package Index, or PyPi_. This install method works on
all supported operating systems.

To install from PyPi you must first have the ``python`` and ``pip`` commands available on your
system. If you don't, see specific instructions for your operating system in this documentation on
how to get the Python environment set up.

To install novelWriter from PyPi, use the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install novelwriter

To upgrade an existing installation, use:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install --upgrade novelwriter

When installing via pip, novelWriter can be launched from command line with:

.. code-block:: bash

   novelwriter

Make sure the install location for pip is in your PATH variable. This is not always the case by
default.

.. note::
   On systems with both Python 2 and 3, you may have to replace the ``pip`` command with ``pip3``.
